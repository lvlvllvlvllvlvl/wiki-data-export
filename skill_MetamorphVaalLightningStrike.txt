|gem_description                         = Infuses your melee weapon with electrical energies as you swing. In addition to converting some of your physical damage to lightning damage, the stored energy becomes an orb attached to the enemy you hit, or the ground if you don't hit an enemy. The orb will periodically fire projectiles at other nearby enemies for a duration, which will also damage the enemy the orb is attached to.
