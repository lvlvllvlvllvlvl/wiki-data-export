|gem_description                         = Sets a marker at a location. Lightning strikes random enemies around the marker repeatedly over the skill's duration, dealing damage in an area around the strike. Modifiers to the skill's duration will also affect the delay between these strikes. When the duration ends, a large bolt of lightning strikes the marker, dealing damage around it.
